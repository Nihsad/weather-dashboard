# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

The purpose of this activity was to familiarize ourselves with using Server-Side APIs. To do this we had to acquire an API from OpenWeatherMap and properly apply it in our JavaScript in order for the weather application to work. The app saves searches to the user's localStorage so previous searches can be retained for comparison purposes.
